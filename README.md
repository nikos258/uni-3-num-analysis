# 001-3-num-analysis2023

A repository which contains algorithms for finding roots of functions, solving linear systems of equations, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices, finding function approximations and calculating approximations of values of definite integrals.

The repository is an implementation of a two-part assignment for the third semester university course numerical analysis. Excercises 1 through 4 and the technical report file concern the first part of the assignment, while excercises 5 through 7 and the technical report 2 file are about the second part of the assignment. The algorithms are implemented in python and the technical reports were made using latex.
